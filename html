<h1 id="intro">What is C++?</h1>
<p>
                    C++ is a general purpose programming
                    language and widely used now a days '
                    for competitive programming. It has
                    imperative, object-oriented and generic
                    programming features. C++ runs on lots of
                    platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
                    C++ is an efficient
                    and powerful language and finds wide use
                    in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
                    real-time simulations. Because of the
                    inclusion of rich function libraries,
                    working in C++ becomes simpler and
                    convenient than C. Being object-oriented
                    programming like Java, C++ provides
                    the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
                    encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
                    exception handling and function overloading.

<h1 id="obj">Objects and Classes</h1>

                    Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name
                    suggests uses objects in programming.
                    Object-oriented programming aims to
                    implement real-world entities like
                    inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
                    etc in programming. The main
                    aim of OOP is to bind together the data
                    and the functions that operate on them
                    so that no other part of the code can
                    access this data except that function.

<h1 id="inherit">Inheritance</h1>
<p>
 The capability of a class to derive
                    properties and characteristics from
                    another class is called Inheritance.
                    Inheritance is one of the most important
                    feature of Object Oriented Programming.
                    Sub Class: The class that inherits
                    properties from another class
                    is called Sub class or Derived Class.
                    Super Class: The class whose properties
                    are inherited by sub class is called Base
                    Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we
                    have to write the functions only one time
                    instead of three times as we
                    have inherited rest of the three classes
                    from base class(Vehicle).

<h1 id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</h1>
<p>
The word polymorphism means having many
                    forms. In simple words, we can define
                    polymorphism as the ability of a message
                    to be displayed in more than one form.
                    A real-life example of polymorphism, a
                    person at the same time can have
                    different characteristics.
                    Like a man at the same time is a father,
                    a husband, an employee. So the same
                    person posses different behavior in
                    different situations. This is called
                    polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
                    as one of the important features of Object
                    Oriented Programming.
